=== How to Test oscap Anaconda Addon

Anaconda has capability to load installer updates using _"updates image"_. This image can loaded from different storages and use different formats. This page should show one working use case, not all possibilities.

(https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda/Updates#How_to_Create_an_Anaconda_Updates_Image)

## What do you need to test your changes? (Summary)
1. Clone repository & use required branch & change code
2. Build image
3. Serve image using HTTP server
4. Load system with update image

## Clone repository & use required branch
You probably want to use rhel7-branch. Currently we don't support Fedora (unsupported python3, ...)

## Build image
We will create cpio archive `ASCII cpio archive (SVR4 with no CRC)` packed using gzip (`gzip compressed data`).

You can call this script in oscap-anaconda-addon repository. It will create `update.img` image.

```
#!/bin/bash

tmp_root=$(mktemp -d)
build_dir=$PWD

# "copy files" to new root
make install DESTDIR="${tmp_root}" >&2

# create update image
cd "$tmp_root"
find -L . | cpio -oc | gzip > "$build_dir/update.img"

# cleanup
rm -rf "$tmp_root"
```
If you want to see what was packed, you can extract the image.
```
mkdir /tmp/content; cd /tmp/content
gzip --decompress | cpio -id < REPO_PATH/update.img
```


### Serve image using HTTP server
You don't need public HTTP server or setup Apache.
You can use simple python HTTP server - it serves all files in you current directory.
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
**Setup your firewall rules correctly to make webserver port accessible from virtual machine.**

## Load system with update image
If you want to load your changes to anaconda, you have to setup boot options correctly.
You have two ways how to setup it:
- Manually
- With PXE boot

If you want to set it manually, you have to boot your machine into grub. Then you can change options (usually using "tab" key).

If you use PXE boot you can pass requires parameters there. Advantage of this solution is that you will not need to change parameters during every boot.

**Required boot parameters:**
```
inst.updates=http://192.168.122.1:8000/update.img
```
